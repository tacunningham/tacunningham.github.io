            <h3 class="extra">Where can moose be seen?</h3>
            <p>
                Moose can be seen anywhere in New Hampshire, but your best bet is to head north. Moose populations are densist in the White Mountains and in the north country of Errol and Pittsburg. In the spring you can see moose on the roadways licking the salt from the previous winter. As the temperatures rise moose can be seen in marshes feasting on aquatic plants, and swimming in ponds and lakes. Moose can also often be seen in large fields grazing on plants and bedding down for the night. Viewing moose in the winter can be challenging as moose typically travel deep into the woods.

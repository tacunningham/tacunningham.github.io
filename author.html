        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>

    <p class="intro">
        My name is Tim and I love to photograph moose. I was born and raised in New Hampshire and currently reside in Manchester. My senior year in high school I became very fascinated with moose and started driving north to the White Mountains to try and catch a glimpse of one. At the time I was not very well-educated on moose behavior so I wasn't very successful at seeing them early on. However with some research and trial and error I learned tricks to seeing moose and getting interesting photographs.

                My first love is hiking which led me to moose. I have two older brother, Joey and Brian. Joey, the oldest, got me into hiking when I was in high school. He took me to climb Mount Chocorua and Mount Moosilaukee and taught me a lot about hiking and the outdoors. As I began to get into hiking more, my brother Brian and his then girlfriend Amy started to join me. I have been fortunate to undertake major hikes with my brothers in New Hampshire, Maine, and Alaska.
